\chapter{Evaluation}
We evaluated our approach strictly on the dimension of performance, specifically measuring runtime performance overhead of the modified Phosphor tool.  We compared our performance overhead against both the original Phosphor work \cite{phosphor_oopsla} and previous partial instrumentation work \cite{manoj_thesis}.  We evaluated the approach using the 9.12-bach release of the DaCapo benchmarks \cite{dacapobach}.  All experiments were performed using an Apple MacBook Pro (2015) running Mac OS 10.11.2 with a 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and 16 GB of RAM. 
\section{Benchmark set}
While Phosphor \cite{phosphor_oopsla} was evaluated using all 14 DaCapo benchmarks included in the 9.12-bach release, \cite{manoj_thesis} was evaluated using only 7 of the 14 benchmarks: avrora, batik, h2, pmd, sunflow, tomcat, and xalan. \{reasonswhy\}  We evaluated our approach on \{bms\}.
