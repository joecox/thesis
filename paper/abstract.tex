\abstract {
Dynamic taint tracking is an important field of study with many
Java-based tools and systems created to implement it, including
\phosphor{}, a general purpose taint tracking tool designed for
commodity JVMs like Oracle and OpenJDK. \phosphor{} works by
instrumenting core Java libraries and the entire application bytecode
with operations to accurately propagate taint information. Prior work
strived to reduce the performance overhead of \phosphor{} by doing
partial instrumentation. The analysis that determined which parts of
the program to instrument was effective but flawed.

This paper aims to improve that analysis and further reduce the
performance overhead by instrumenting less of the program. We use the
Petablox program analysis tool and custom Datalog rules to perform an
information flow analysis that better models \phosphor{}'s behavior,
including calls across native library boundaries. We find that we
obtain a reduction in the amount of a program that needs to be
instrumented by 79.9\%.  }
