\chapter{Conclusion}
We were able to write an improved information flow analysis compared to previous work which enabled us to reduce the amount of instrumentation required to track data through a program with Phosphor. We made a key assumption which restricts the functionality of Phosphor, but allows for a significant reduction in performance overhead. While much of that reduction came from a reachability analysis in Petablox, our analysis also made a significant contribution.

We were not successful in completely evaluating our approach, as we were not able to measure performance overhead by directly running the updated version of Phosphor on the Dacapo benchmarks.
