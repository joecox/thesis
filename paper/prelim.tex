\acknowledgments {I would like to profusely thank Dr. Jens Palsberg for the incredible patience, kindness, and support he has shown me during my time as a Masters student. Thank you for welcoming me to research as an undergraduate and allowing me to stay on as a Masters student and enjoy the ride. I have learned more about program analysis than I ever thought I would and more about life than I did in my entire undergraduate career.

I would also like to thank Christian, John, and Matt for being such wonderful lab mates and friends. Thank you for helping me understand the week's paper, the day's lecture, or whatever else I would ask about. Thank you for helping me navigate through grad school, being such patient teachers, and always fostering a great environment in lab.
