\section{Phosphor}
\section{Partial Instrumentation}
This subset of methods is generated by calculating a callgraph intersection. The callgraph of a program is produced statically and the set of methods on the outward callgraphs from each source method is intersected with the set of methods on the inwards callgraphs into each sink method. This approach is able to achieve
