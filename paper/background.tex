\chapter{Background and Prior Work}
This paper builds on a number of existing tools and prior work done by the author and others. In this chapter we describe the existing tools in greater detail and how they were modified or supplemented to support the analysis in the paper. We also describe prior work on partial instrumentation in greater detail to help elucidate the differences between the analysis in that prior work and the analysis in this paper.
\section{Phosphor}
Phosphor is a general purpose taint tracking tool

taint tag info

example tag propagation

native

source and sinks

jdk stuff, eval
\section{Petablox}
Petablox is large-scale program analysis tool. Datalog, bddbddb, logicblox, doop, new schema

includes analyses like deadlock, datarace, k-cfa object sensitive and insensitive analysis

Datalog engine, bddbddb, logicblox

doop, new schema

limitations of new schema, primitives, natives, constants
\section{Partial Instrumentation}
Don't have to instrument everything if data doesn't touch everything

Callgraph

Callgraph intersection

Special cases

Modification of phosphor

limitations: native

This subset of methods is generated by calculating a callgraph intersection. The callgraph of a program is produced statically and the set of methods on the outward callgraphs from each source method is intersected with the set of methods on the inwards callgraphs into each sink method. This approach is able to achieve
